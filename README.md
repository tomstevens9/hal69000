# Notes
* volumes static and media need to be created in docker before running
* createsuperuser needs to be run with docker exec on first run
* This project relies on an instance of Nginx installed to manage TLS

# Todo
* Remove "sensitive" data from git history? (Not used in prod)
* Add linting
* Add tests
